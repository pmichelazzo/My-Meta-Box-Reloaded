# Easy WordPress Metabox Class

## What is this?
This class is used to create meta boxes with fields inside of any WordPress
content type (custom or not) without the hard job to code the meta boxes and
fields. to do that, you just need to call the class, set some parameters for
the meta boxes, write the fields passing some parameters and, that's it, the
job is done!

## Why another class/plugin/code/whatever to handle meta boxes
Well, why do we have so many different cars models? Why we have so many different
smartphones? TV's? Operating Systems? Computers?

There's a lot of options to work with meta boxes around. The WordPress ecosystem
is huge and every day we find a new code to solve WordPress problems (IMHO, the
WP content types is one of the worst).

This class solved a need that I had and I decide to share. Feel free to use it
or, perhaps, find a better or beautiful option. It's up to you :)

## The history behind the code
This code has a long story. First, is derived from Meta Box script by Rilwis
(rilwis@gmail.com) version 3.2, which later was forked by Cory Crowley
(cory.ivan@gmail.com) and later on, forked by Raz Ohad (https://github.com/bainternet).
One day, looking for an easy class to finish a job to a client, I found the 
last fork but, since the repo looks "abandoned" and I need some changes to
accomplish my tasks, I decided to rebuild the class, adding new features,
remove old ones and make the code better and reliable. But, of course, I need
to say a big "Thank you" to the previous authors for the job done.

## Documentation and how to use
I love documentation (inside and outside the code). You don't need to search the
code to find parameters or something else. Goes to the [wiki](https://github.com/pmichelazzo/easy-wp-metabox/wiki)
and you'll find everything there :)

## To Do, new features and issues
You can check the plans for this code on the [Project dashboard](https://github.com/pmichelazzo/easy-wp-metabox/projects/1).
I always listen the user's needs and try to do my best to add new features in
the code.

If you have issues, open a new one on the Issues page. Also, you can contact me
directly by [email](michelazzo@me.com).

Have fun!
