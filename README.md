# Easy WordPress Metabox Class

## What is this?
This class is used to create meta boxes with fields inside of any WordPress
content type (custom or not) without the hard job to code the meta boxes and
fields and without dependencies from external code/plugins. To use, you just
need to call the class, set some parameters for the meta boxes, write the fields
passing some parameters and the job is done!

## Why another class/plugin/code/whatever to handle meta boxes
Well, why do we have so many different cars models? Why we have so many different
smartphones? TV's? Operating Systems? Computers?

There's a lot of options to work with meta boxes around. The WordPress ecosystem
is huge and every day we find a new code to solve WordPress problems (IMHO, the
WP content types is one of the worst).

But, there is a big difference between this class and plugins that you can find
on the web: **dependencies**. In other words, you don't need to install another
plugin to create meta boxes with fields and your custom content type **is not**
dependent of anything else. On this way, you can share your custom content type
or plugin for someone and everything you need is here: datepickers, colorpickers,
fields, nice selection boxes, etc.
No additional code, no additional plugins, nothing. Just a class you call from
your code. That's it.

This class solved a problem that I had and I decide to share. Feel free to use it
or, perhaps, find a better or beautiful option. It's up to you :)

## The history behind the code
This code has a long story. First, is derived from Meta Box script by Rilwis
(rilwis@gmail.com) version 3.2, which later was forked by Cory Crowley
(cory.ivan@gmail.com) and later on, forked by Raz Ohad (https://github.com/bainternet).
One day, looking for an easy class to finish a job to a client, I found the 
last fork but, since the repo looks "abandoned" and I need some changes to
accomplish my tasks, I decided to rebuild the class, adding new features,
remove old ones and make the code better and reliable. But, of course, I need
to say a big "Thank you" to the previous authors for the job done.

## Documentation and how to use
I love documentation (inside and outside the code). You don't need to search the
code to find parameters or something else. Goes to the [wiki](https://github.com/pmichelazzo/easy-wp-metabox/wiki)
and you'll find everything there :)

## To do, new features and issues
You can check the plans for this code on the [Project dashboard](https://github.com/pmichelazzo/easy-wp-metabox/projects/1).
I always listen the user's needs and try to do my best to add new features in
the code.

If you have issues, open a new one on the Issues page. Also, you can contact me
directly by [email](michelazzo@me.com).

Have fun!
